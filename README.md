# ccdc
CCDC Scripts- Mostly just knockoffs of great tools modified for the CCDC environment

WindowsFIM - This is a knock off of Artillery.py. It takes the FIM part and is standalone windows FIM that forwards to a specified syslog server. Works with Python 2.7

PaloAltoConfig - This is a script to generate a text file that can be pasted into you SSH session to the PA firewall. It worked for the Minnesota State CCDC 2017 and willrequire light modifications for the Midwest region or future Midwest state competitions given they don't change very much from year to year.
